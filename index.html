            <strong>Arsène Who?</strong>
            <p>Arsène Charles Ernest Wenger is a French football manager and former player. He was the manager of Arsenal from 1996 to 2018, where he was the longest-serving and most successful in the club's history.</p>
            <p>In 1996, both Arsenal and football were in a period of stagnation. The Premier League was under the threat of being dominated by Sir Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United while English football was plagued with a drinking and smoking culture amongst players, making the beautiful game almost an unhealthy and lethargic pastime. One of the most ‘unathletic’ clubs was Arsenal, with the infamous ‘Tuesday Club’ organised by club captain Tony Adams making headlines for all the wrong reasons. After the sacking of Bruce Rioch twenty-one-and-a-half years ago, many Gunners fans wished for names such as Johan Cruyff or Kevin Keegan to take the manager’s role. Little did they know that when an unknown Wenger arrived in North London in September 1996, a new hero for the next few generations of Arsenal fans would change the face of football forever.</p>
            <p>Having spent most of his managerial career in his native France, as well as a brief career in Japan, Wenger brought over a new culture of football which is now common logic amongst even the most amateur of footballers. Out went the drinking culture, in came a new and improved eating diet; football became an athletic sport again.</p>
            <p>These innovations caused Arsenal to play some of the most eye-catching football the league has ever seen, creating new heroes such as Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira, and while the new football ‘modernisms’ raised a few heads, the North London side challenged Manchester United’s domestic dominance. Red Devils manager Alex Ferguson reacted to Wenger’s appointment saying that “he comes from Japan, he knows nothing about football”. The accuracy of this quote was tested when Arsenal won the 1998 League and Cup double in Wenger’s first full season in charge. From that moment on, Arsenal and Wenger created a rivalry with United and Ferguson which enticed football fans from all over the world. A second domestic double arrived in North London in 2002, a feat which was topped by Wenger two years later in a truly remarkable season; the Invincibles campaign. Arsenal went the entire of the 2003/04 Premier League season without losing a single match, an achievement which had not been made since 1889. The first eight years of Wenger’s reign had already put him at a legendary status in English football. It was the next eight years which really tested the Frenchman’s resolve.</p>
            <p>After the Invincibles season, the Gunners threatened to conquer European football, becoming the first London side to reach the Champions League Final in 2006. However, a controversial defeat to FC Barcelona in Paris became the last great Wenger achievement for almost a decade. A ground move from the historic Highbury Stadium to the modern and swanky Emirates Stadium in Ashburton Grove put a strain on Arsenal’s finances. Several loans from various banking companies meant that the main method of paying back those funds was through player sales and profit in the transfer market. On top of that, Arsenal’s reputation in domestic football was under serious threat with Manchester City and Chelsea receiving oligarchic funding from Dubai and Russia respectively, meaning even more competition for domestic trophies. With all this in mind, the Arsenal hierarchy gave Wenger the target of reaching the top four Champions League qualification places in five of the first seven seasons at the Emirates Stadium. Guess what, he finished there seven times out of seven. In fact, Wenger can boast the record of qualifying for the Champions League for TWENTY consecutive years, a feat only managed by Real Madrid and Barcelona. A nine-year trophy drought, caused by the Gunners’ financial struggles, was ended in dramatic style with three FA Cup wins in four years between 2014 and 2017. The Frenchman’s managerial ability to consistency keep Arsenal at the top of the football pyramid cannot be underestimated.</p>
